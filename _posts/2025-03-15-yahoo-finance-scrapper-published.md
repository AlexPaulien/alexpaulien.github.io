Hello! I just published a first project on my github website about scrapping financial data from Yahoo Finance. This started as something I needed personally in order to analyze some stocks but thought I could share this. It is a relatively simple script taking advantage of regular expressions (regex) to parse the targert url html structure and extract the relevant data.

You can check it out using the below links:
- [project page](https://alexpaulien.github.io/projects/1_project_yahoo_finance_scrapping/)
- [github repository](https://github.com/AlexPaulien/yahoo-finance-scrapper/tree/main)
- [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ivlx86/yahoo-finance-scrapping)

I'll probably add some new things to it later on and will make sure to post updates when this happens.
